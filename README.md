# Todo List App

This is a Todo List app that I have created as part of the Angela Yu - Web Developer Bootcamp course.

This app was a Capstone Project which are projects totally created on your own without an tutorial. The project is tasked at the end of the EJS section of the course.

The technologies used in this project are as follows:

**HTML**
**CSS**
**Javascript**
**Node**
**Express**
**EJS**
